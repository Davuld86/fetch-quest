swordsman: 'Born on the battlefield, the Swordsman is a paragon of strength and resilience. Their health pool is a testament to their enduring spirit, while their mighty swings deal devastating blows. Toughened through combat, they weather attacks with ease, though their understanding of magic is limited.',
archer: 'The Archer moves with the grace of the wind, their arrows finding their mark with unerring precision. Their physique, honed through relentless training, grants them a robust constitution. Agile and swift, the Archer sacrifices some defense for unmatched accuracy in both ranged and magical attacks.',
thief: 'A master of shadows and deception, the Thief relies on agility and subtlety. Their health and combat skills reflect a life of calculated risks and daring maneuvers. While their finesse in both physical and magical strikes is undeniable, their choice of lightweight gear leaves them vulnerable to direct hits.',
wizard: "Wielding the ancient art of magic, the Wizard's essence is intertwined with the arcane. Their health, though modest, is supplemented by an expansive mana pool, a testament to their connection with mystical energies. However, their physical prowess suffers as they dedicate themselves to the study of spells and enchantments.",
