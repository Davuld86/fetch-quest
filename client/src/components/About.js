        <p>Hey I'm David, I made RingTail Realm for my final project!</p>
        <p>Every 'how to become a programmer in 6 months' video on
             youtube always said to make your capstone project a Facebook (now named Meta) / Twitter (now named X) clone, but I thought that was done to death.
             </p>
             <p>So, instead I made a clone of Club Penguin! </p>
             <p>Took a lot longer than I thought it would to make, but with a lot of effort (and a little help from ChatGPT) here it is!</p>

        <p>Anyway, I hope you liked it/found it somewhat charming! </p>
