        <p>Hey, I'm David. I made Ringtail Realm for my final project.</p>
        <p>I found that every "How to Become a Programmer in X Months" video on
             Youtube always say to make your capstone project a clone of Meta, X or Instagram, but I found that boring as that's been done to death.
             </p>
             <p>So, instead I made a clone of Club Penguin! </p>
             <img style={{height:'100px', width:'100px' }} src='../images/peggin.gif'/>
             <p>This took a lot longer than I thought it would to make, but with a lot of effort (and a little help from ChatGPT) here it is!</p>
        <img style={{height:'400px'}} src='../images/programming.gif'/>
        <p>^^ me working on this for the last 2-ish months ૮꒰˶  - ˕ -꒱ა ^^</p>
        <p>Anyway, I hope you liked it/found it somewhat interesting. </p>
